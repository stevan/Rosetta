# Rosetta

This module attempt to provide a DOM manipulation and AJAX
API that supports multiple backends, specifically jQuery
and YUI for now. This is based largely on the information
found on the http://www.jsrosettastone.com/ website.

Note that this library implements really only the basics that
one might need, some of the features are intentionally left
blank. That said, patches are always welcome.
